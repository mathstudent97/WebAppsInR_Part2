#### What is BMI?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person [1].

#### Calculating the BMI
BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (in kg) by their squared height (in m).
Note equation below:

> BMI = kg/m^2

Where *kg* represents the person's weight; *m^2* represents the person's height squared.
